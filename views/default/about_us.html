          <p class="lead">
This website is a product of four computer science students coming together to solve a problem at Miramonte High School.  The problem is the confusion and lack of information surrounding clubs at Miramonte.  We wanted to create a database compiling info about the many awesome clubs that Miramonte students can join. </p> <p class = "lead">

What began as a simple idea for an AP Computer Science project has now transformed into an exciting new endeavor with thrilling possibilities! </p>
